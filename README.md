# Operation WIRE STORM submission
You can find the challenge, ran by CoreTech [here](https://www.coretechsec.com/operation-wire-storm).

# Dependencies
You will need a working `rustc`/`cargo` installation which supports `edition = 2024` of Rust (the latest stable release will).

You can download this [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

# Quickstart
Once you are in the project root, run:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

# ADR
The [ADR](./ADR.md) documents some assumptions I made during development, and informed overall design decisions.
